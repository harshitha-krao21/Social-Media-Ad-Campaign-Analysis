# Social-Media-Ad-Campaign-Analysis
The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of XYZ Company's Facebook ad campaigns by addressing key questions across three areas: descriptive analysis, predictive analysis, and grouping analysis.

# Descriptive Analysis
1. Which demographic groups (age, gender) engage the most with the ads, based on clicks
and conversions?
2. How do users' interests, as indicated on their Facebook profiles, influence ad engagement
in terms of impressions and clicks?
# Predictive Analysis
1. What factors (ad characteristics, user demographics, interests) most accurately predict the
likelihood of conversion?
2. Which factors, such as impressions, clicks, or ad spend, have the greatest impact on
conversion rates?
# Grouping Analysis
1. To distinguish high and low performers, how can ads be categorized based on
performance metrics like impressions, clicks, and spending?
2. How do different ad groups, such as low-impression/high-spend or high-click ads,
perform in terms of conversions?

# Methodology:
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Clustering Analysis
Predictive Modeling
Optimization of Ad Spending
